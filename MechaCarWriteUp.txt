MPG Regression

After running multiple regression models, we are able to determine that car length and ground clearance had the clearest positive correlation to mpg. We calculated P-values of 9.56 (length v MPG) and 6.55 (Clearance v MPG) respectively.





Compare these models to other below which don’t have a clear correlation.



Suspension Coil Summary

When going through analysis of 150 suspension coils we find the following statistics:
MEAN: 1498.78
MEDIAN: 1500
VARIANCE: 62.29
STANDARD DEVIATION: 7.89

We can conclude this data set to have normal distribution.  We find that the data shows that the suspension coils do not exceed 100 lbs/inch.

Suspension Coil T-Test
We show the following results for a One sample t-test:

data:  (coil_sample_table$PSI)
t = 1.6207, df = 49, p-value = 0.1115
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1498.78
95 percent confidence interval:
 1498.348 1502.812
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1500.58

We also show the following for a Two sample t-test:

data:  (coil_sample_table$PSI) and (coil_sample_table2$PSI)
t = 1.4277, df = 97.977, p-value = 0.1566
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.8813272  5.4013272
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
  1500.58   1498.32

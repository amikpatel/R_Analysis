# R_analysis
 
Learned to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data; visualize the data; and analyze the data using R. Additionally, learned a variety of statistical tests, their real-world application in data science, and their implementation in R.

-Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.

-Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.

-Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.

-Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.

-Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.

-Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.

-Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given 
dataset.

-Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.

-Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.

-Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.
